## üß† Dev Notes

- Use foreign key constraints to ensure Player and Level consistency.
- Consider indexing PlayerLevel on `Player` + `Level` for fast lookup.
- Completion logic can be determined from scores or explicitly tracked (added `Completed` field).
- `PlayerLevelHistory` can be used to track retry attempts or improvements.
- Consider gamification elements: badges, progress bars, unlockable maps.
- Future configs: Add JSON-based field in LevelConfig for dynamic rule definitions.
